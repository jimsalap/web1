  <p>There <em><strong>5 members</strong></em> in <u>my family</u>. Hyun Jung Lee
  Yeonsoo(Amy), Hyoeun(Sally), Haesol(Emily). Now we are living 
  in Fairfax, VA, USA.</p><p>We migrated into 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" target="_blank" title="USA에 대해서 specification">
  USA</a> in Feb. 2011. At first, the reason we came
  to USA was for my own study. I had had a plan to improve my English.
  After 1 year, all of my family became so satisfied with the lives 
  in the USA. So, we decided to stay in the US as long as we could.
  The problem is, we needed to change our status to stay longer and work freely by getting Green Card. 
  It is not easy to get a Green Card as long as you don't have a lot of money.
  For, you can't work freely with the status of F visa, which we had had since we got 
  into the US.</p>

  <p>First, we had to find a way to get a <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/green-card/green-card-eligibility-categories" target="blank">Green Card</a>. There were so many ways to do that. 
  As I mentioned earlier, the problem was money. My wife made a try to ask some amount
  of money to her mom to start the process for the Green Care.
  But, money was not the only proble in the process. We have to find a path for the card. Fortunately, 
  one of my friends found a sponsor for me to get a green card by working for the sponsor.</p>
